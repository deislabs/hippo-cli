# Hippo Client

`hippo` is an **experimental** client for the [Hippo
PaaS](https://github.com/deislabs/hippo).

The `hippo` tool interacts directly with the Hippo API. Its primary purpose is
to interact with the various endpoints provided by the
[hippo-openapi](https://github.com/fermyon/hippo-openapi) project.

Users seeking to build, deploy, and run applications should look at
[spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/).

## Using the Hippo Client

### Logging in

```console
$ hippo login
Enter username: bacongobbler
Enter password: [hidden]
Logged in as bacongobbler
```

Authentication is handled through `hippo login`, which logs into Hippo. With
`hippo login`, the Hippo URL is specified in the `--url` flag. Hippo requires
authentication: if `--username` or `--password` are not provided, the CLI will
prompt for that information.

Logging out can be performed with `hippo logout`, which logs out of Hippo.

```console
$ hippo logout
Logged out
```

If you want to skip server TLS verification, pass the `-k` flag to `hippo
login`. This can be useful if you are running development services with
self-signed certificates.

**Note: the `-k` and `--danger-accept-invalid-certs` flags are a security risk.
Do not use them in production.**

### Creating an Application

```console
$ hippo app add helloworld helloworld
Added App helloworld (ID = 'e4a30d14-4536-4f4a-81d5-80e961e7710c')
IMPORTANT: save this App ID for later - you will need it to update and/or delete the App
```

### Creating a Channel

```console
$ hippo channel add latest e4a30d14-4536-4f4a-81d5-80e961e7710c
Added Channel latest (ID = '685ff7d8-7eef-456f-ad5a-4c5c39975588')
IMPORTANT: save this Channel ID for later - you will need it to update and/or delete the Channel
```

If not specified, Hippo to deploys the latest revision. This can be changed by
either providing a different `--range-rule`, or by specifying a `--revision-id`.

By default, Hippo will bind the channel to a domain with the address
`<channel_name>.<app_name>.<platform_domain>`. In this case,
`latest.helloworld.hippofactory.local`. If you want to change this domain,
use the `--domain` flag.

### Creating a Revision

If you pushed a bindle to bindle-server called `helloworld/1.0.0`:

```console
$ hippo revision add helloworld 1.0.0
Added Revision 1.0.0
```

If any applications use that storage ID, all its channels will be re-evaluated
to determine if they need to be re-schedule the new revision to the job
scheduler.

### Adding an Environment Variable

```console
$ hippo env add HELLO world 685ff7d8-7eef-456f-ad5a-4c5c39975588
Added Environment Variable HELLO (ID = 'c97f9855-d998-4dac-889b-11b553f53bea')
IMPORTANT: save this Environment Variable ID for later - you will need it to update and/or delete the Environment Variable
```

### Deploying an existing Bindle

To automate the process, Hippo provides a command to automate the process of
creating an application, channel, and registering a revision in one command:
`hippo deploy`.

Assuming you pushed a bindle with the ID `helloworld/1.0.0`:

```console
$ hippo deploy helloworld 1.0.0
Deployed helloworld/1.0.0
```

## Building from source

```console
cargo build --release
```
